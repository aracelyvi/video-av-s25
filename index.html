        <p>This is a compilation of movie trailers that I have recently watched and enjoyed. PSA: I enjoy horror movies.</p>

            <h2>Heretic</h2>
            <p>Heretic is about faith and whether the main charcters will stick to their beliefs when put into a life-or-death situation. 
              <br>
              It was creepy without being too scary. A good mix of psychological horror and thriller film.</p>

            <h2>Talk To Me</h2>
            <p>Talk To Me is a very interesting story about a game between friends going completely wrong. In Talk To Me, the main character 
              <br>contacts the afterlife and uses that as a way to cope with the grief of her mom passing. This movie has become one of my favorite movies 
              <br>in general because I really enjoy the ending. TW: TRAILER CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT </p>

            <h2>The Florida Project</h2>
            <p>The Florida Project is a emotional movie that I think is very interesting, the movie follows the children's perspective. The troubles of 
              <br>
              the children's situations are based on what we assumed from the kid's interactions. It is a very good movie but very sad as well.</p>
